# Machine-Learning-Algorithms

## Overview
In my Data Science course, I learned the principle of some of the most common supervised ML algorithms such as linear/logistic regression, KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, as well as upsupervised, KMeans algorithm. For my term project, I self researched how the Deep Learning Neural Network works and picked CNN topic to trained and tested the MNIST dataset from Keras.

## Weekly Assignments

### Week 3- K Nearest Neighbor

Conducted banknote classicfication from he banknote authentication Data Set from UCI Machine learning Repository. Data set consist of 4 features ("variance", "skewness", "curtosis", "entropy") and a true label column. In this assignment, I conducted a pair plot from seanborn to visualize the relationship between each features as below.
