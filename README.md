# Machine-Learning-Algorithms

## Overview
In my Data Science course, I learned the principle of some of the most common supervised ML algorithms such as linear/logistic regression, KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, as well as upsupervised, KMeans algorithm. For my term project, I self researched how the Deep Learning Neural Network works and picked CNN topic to trained and tested the MNIST dataset from Keras.

## Weekly Assignments

### Week3- K Nearest Neighbor
Conducted banknote classicfication from he banknote authentication Data Set from UCI Machine learning Repository. Data set consist of 4 features ("variance", "skewness", "curtosis", "entropy") and a true label column. 

In this assignment, I conducted a pair plot from seanborn to visualize the relationship between each features as below.

Based on the pairplot, we can noticibly see the plot to be categorical rather than continuous. With that, I trained the dataset with KNN and obtained nearly 100% accuracy.

### Week4- Linear Regression
Conducted heart failure regression models from selecting 2 of the 13 features included in the heart failure clinical records data set at UCI by using various linear regression models.

In this assignment, I counded heatmaps to visually see the relationship between each features through colors.
